A converter for Xunlei Kankan's xve files.

Xunlei Kankan has been a very popular media player software that boasts its video library, including millions of films and episodes etc. The author discovered the structure and encryption methods of its proprietary local cache files, using some very sophiscated techniques, and provides users with an easy-to-use application to convert them into regular video files. This program had been a unique solution to this popular demand for years and had tens of thousands of users. (search "xve转换器" for yourself!) It was written some 10 years ago when I was in middle school.
